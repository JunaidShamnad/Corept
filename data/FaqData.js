      question: 'What is post tensioning?',
      answer: 'Post tensioning is where prestressing force is permanently introduced into the concrete structure after the concrete has hardened. By stressing properly positioned high strength prestressing tendons with the help of Stressing Jack.',

      question: 'How Post Tensioning is done?',
      answer: 'Post tensioning is a technique for reinforcing concrete. Post-tensioning tendons, which are prestressing steel cables inside plastic ducts or sleeves, are positioned in the forms before the concrete is placed.',
      id: '2',
    },
    {
      question: 'How it affects design?',
      answer: 'The good thing about pre tensioned members is that it eliminates the loss of strength due to friction of tendons against the tendon duct. BETTER Post tensioned members are subject to friction loss. ',
