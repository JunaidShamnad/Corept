      question: 'What is post tensioning?',
      answer: 'Post tensioning is where prestressing force is permanently introduced into the concrete structure after the concrete has hardened. By stressing properly positioned high strength prestressing tendons with the help of Stressing Jack.',

      question: 'Which is better pre tensioning or post tensioning?',
      answer: 'Each has its advantages. Pre-tension is are preferred for mass production of similar setup off-site (e.g. concrete piles) . The setup is more complex and is more delicate in details. Post-tension is preferred for on-site installation. The stressing equipment is portable and easy to use.',

    {
      question: 'How it affects design?',
      answer: 'The good thing about pre tensioned members is that it eliminates the loss of strength due to friction of tendons against the tendon duct. BETTER Post tensioned members are subject to friction loss. ',
